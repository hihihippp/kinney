# Kinney

An oral history video clips site packaged as a Rails gem.

# Story

This code was originally part of a site (currently unreleased) created for the [Student Leadership Initiative](http://news.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/category/student-leaders/). The codename for the internal project is Sleader, so this project was named Kinney. 

Abstracting the code out into this Rails Engine is currently incomplete and possibly unusable, but it is ongoing. We are currently in the process of moving over to using this plugin for our own work.

# Install

1. Create a fresh Rails application
2. Add the following to your Gemfile: 
`gem 'kinney', :git => 'git://github.com/jronallo/kinney.git'`
3. `bundle`
4. For further installation and usage, you will need to consult the test/dummy application for what you might need for a working setup. Generators are forthcoming.
