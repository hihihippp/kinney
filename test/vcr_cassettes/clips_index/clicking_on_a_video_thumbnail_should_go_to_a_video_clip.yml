        time but it also was a time of great student intrigue \r\n\r\n2\r\n00:00:06
        --> 00:00:10\r\nand the kind of who-dun-it syndrome set in. \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:11
        --> 00:00:15\r\nBeing where Pullen Hall was and where the school of design
        was-\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:16 --> 00:00:19\r\nand the fact we never left the school
        of design until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:20 --> 00:00:23\r\n-when
        that fire broke out, which was give or take about midnight,\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:24
        --> 00:00:32\r\nI mean we could see the blaze, and of course we all moved-I
        say we all; maybe there were, I don't know, twenty-five of us or whatever\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:33
        --> 00:00:37\r\n-but we all moved over, and I mean it was just absolutely
        incredible, \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:38 --> 00:00:42\r\nand of course it was a wood
        frame building. \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:43 --> 00:00:48\r\nI've never seen a fire
        like that since then, \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:49 --> 00:00:55\r\nI mean just an
        incredible fire, and then of course these fires would start showing up in
        other places. \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:56 --> 00:01:01\r\nAt that time at the university
        you could almost go in any academic building any time of the day. \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:02
        --> 00:01:05\r\nI mean there just wasn't the security that you have on campus
        today, \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:01:06 --> 00:01:12\r\nThey did not catch-. The academic
        year finished up and they had not caught the culprit. \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:01:13
        --> 00:01:17\r\nIt was well into the summer before they caught the individual
        who did it, \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:01:18 --> 00:01:22\r\nI wouldn't sit here and
        tell you we all went around in great fear, \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:01:23 --> 00:01:29\r\nbut
        it was frightening in a sense of a disturbing way, that this would be going
        on at campus. \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:01:30 --> 00:01:34\r\nIt's certainly not the
        frightening kind of sense of what we live with in today's world, \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:01:35
        --> 00:01:40\r\nthough I'm not saying we go around every day thinking about
        it, of a terrorist kind of thing, \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:01:41 --> 00:01:49\r\nand
        as I say all the who-dun-it stuff probably played out more than anything that
        dealt with fright or fear."
